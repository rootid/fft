* We can calculate the sum of the elements in the array by traversing the array once. 
* Since the array elements can be quite large, we need to use the long data types for the sum. 
* A signed 32−bit integer value uses the 1st bit to represent the sign of the number 
* and the remaining 31−bits to represent the magnitude. 
* The range of the 32−bit integer is −231 to 231−1 or [−2147483648,2147483647]. 
* When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed this range. 
* Use long long in C/C++ and long in Java.
