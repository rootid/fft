//Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
//Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
//on day i.
//Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
//transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock
//multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the
//same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
//Obs:
//we can't sell and buy in the same day
//From this, we can simply jude the positive profit,and sum them up
//
//
///The idea: We will sell the stock today, if today's profit is greater than tomorrow's profit.
///Proof
///There is a list of the stock [A0,A1,A2....Ax...Ai,Aj..Ak,...An-1]
///Condition:
///1 Now we are on Ai and we get the minimum prices Ax.
///2 Ai -Ax > Aj -Ax
///If we sell it on the Kth day when Ak-Ax>Ai-Ax. the overall profit we get on day K is Ak-Ax.
///But if we sell it on day i, the profit on day K would be >= Ai-Ax + Ak -Aj.
///We know Ai-Ax + Ak -Aj = Ak-Ax + Ai -Aj > Ak-Ax, so to gain more profit on day K, we should sell it on Day i.
// 2 cases
// 1. Monotonic increase/decrease
// 1. Bitonic  increase
