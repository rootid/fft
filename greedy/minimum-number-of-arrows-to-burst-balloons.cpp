//There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For
//each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the
//horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and
//hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is
//always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
//An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the
//x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart
//≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An
//arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the
//minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
//Example:
//Input:
//[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
//Output:
//2
//Explanation:
//One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons
//[2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two
//balloons).
