##  Patching Array
### Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.
Example 1:
nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Return 1.
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
Example 2:
nums = [1, 5, 10], n = 20
Return 2.
The two patches can be [2, 4].
Example 3:
nums = [1, 2, 2], n = 5
Return 0.
	
## Gas Station
### There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
Note:
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
	
## Candy
###  There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
