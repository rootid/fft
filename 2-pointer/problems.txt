## Intersection of Two Arrays
### Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].
Note:
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.
	
## Intersection of Two Arrays II
### Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
Note:
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
Follow up:
What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
	
## Find the Duplicate Number
###  Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
Note:
You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
	
## Move Zeroes
### Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
