//Student Attendance Record II
//Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance
//records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may
//be very large, return it after mod 10^9 + 7.
//A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following
//three characters:
//'A' : Absent.
//'L' : Late.
//'P' : Present.
//A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A'
//(absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 2
//Output: 8
//Explanation:
//There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
//"PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
//Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent
//times.
//Note: The value of n won't exceed 100,000.

//Let R(n) be the number of all rewardable records without A.
//
//Thinking the problem as replacing Ps and As on an array of Ls instead. Since
//the constraint is no more than 3 continuous Ls is allowed. For a n-size
//array, let's just look into the first 3 places, since there must be at least
//on replacement been taken place there:
//
//First, let's consider the case we replacing with P. There're 3 cases:
//
//P??: meaning we replace the first L with P. Doing so will shrink the problem
//size by one, so the number of this case is Q(n-1);
//LP?: meaning we replace the second L with P. The first place got to be L
//since the case where P in the first place is being considered above. So the
//number of this case is Q(n-2);
//LLP: meaning we replace the third L with P. Leaving us the number of Q(n-3);
//Now let's consider the case we replacing with A:
//
//A??: This we narrow down the problem size by one, and for the rest places
//there must be no As. So the number is R(n-1);
//LA?: this will be R(n-2);
//LLA: this will be R(n-3);
//It's easy to see that the recurrence formula of R is just similar to the
//first 3 cases combined, namely:
//R(n) = R(n-1) + R(n-2) + R(n-3)
//
//So the recurrence formula of Q is:
//
//Q(n) = Q(n-1) + Q(n-2) + Q(n-3) + R(n-1) + R(n-2) + R(n-3)
//     = Q(n-1) + Q(n-2) + Q(n-3) + R(n)

//######################################### O(log n) #########################################
//The runtime of this solution is clearly O(n), using linear space (which can
//be easily optimized to O(1) though). Now, let's see how to further improve
//the runtime.
//In fact, if we treat f[i][][] and f[i-1][][] as two vectors, we can represent
//the recurrence of f[i][j][k] as follows:

//f[i][0][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 0 |   f[i-1][0][0]
//f[i][0][1]   | 1 0 1 0 0 0 |   f[i-1][0][1]
//f[i][0][2] = | 0 1 1 0 0 0 | * f[i-1][0][2]
//f[i][1][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 1 |   f[i-1][1][0]
//f[i][1][1]   | 0 0 1 1 0 1 |   f[i-1][1][1]
//f[i][1][2]   | 0 0 1 0 1 1 |   f[i-1][1][2]
//Let A be the matrix above, then f[n][][] = A^n * f[0][][], where f[0][][] =
//[1 1 1 1 1 1]. The point of this approach is that we can compute A^n using
//exponentiating by squaring (thanks to @StefanPochmann for the name
//correction), which will take O(6^3 * log n) = O(log n) time. Therefore, the
//runtime improves to O(log n), which suffices to handle the case for much
//larger n, say 10^18.
//Update: The final answer is f[n][1][2], which involves multiplying the last
//row of A^n and the column vector [1 1 1 1 1 1]. Interestingly, it is also
//equal to A^(n+1)[5][2] as the third column of A is just that vector. Credit
//to @StefanPochmann.

//f[i][0][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 0 |   f[i-1][0][0]
//f[i][0][1]   | 1 0 1 0 0 0 |   f[i-1][0][1]
//f[i][0][2] = | 0 1 1 0 0 0 | * f[i-1][0][2]
//f[i][1][0]   | 0 0 1 0 0 1 |   f[i-1][1][0]
//f[i][1][1]   | 0 0 1 1 0 1 |   f[i-1][1][1]
//f[i][1][2]   | 0 0 1 0 1 1 |   f[i-1][1][2]
//The top row says that:
//
//f[i][0][0] = f[i-1][0][2]
//Why? We want at most 0 trailing L's, so the previous (i-1) case where we
//allow 0, 1, or 2 L's, we can simply add a 'P', and that get's the current (i)
//case. We don't need any of the f[i-1][1][x] cases, since we don't allow A's.
//And we don't need the f[i-1][0] and f[i-1][1] cases because those are already
//counted in the f[i-1][2] case.
//
//Moving on:
//
//f[i][0][1] = f[i-1][0][0] + f[i-1][0][2]
//Why? We want at most 1 trailing L, so we can either take a case with no L's
//(f[i-1][0]) and add an 'L', or we can take one with up to 2 L's (f[i-1][2])
//and add a 'P'. f[i-1][0][1] isn't included here because adding an 'L' to it
//would give us 2 L's, which is outside the desired k of 1, and adding a 'P' to
//it is already covered by f[i-1][2], which covers 0, 1, or 2 trailing L's.
