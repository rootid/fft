Count Numbers with Unique Digits

The first question debug. Give you a large program, no grammatical mistakes make you wrong. Wrong distribution: equals and == wrong to use,> and <conditions to determine the wrong, static variable wrong to use.
The second problem programming: similar to the sort color.
The third title programming: similar to the unique number.

60 minutes three time is very tight, I did not finish. Difficulty is to complete multiple topics in a short time. High requirements for basic skills.
The first question is a long debug, probably meaning: a class provides add and find methods, the method void add (number) can add an item. The method find (min, max) returns the results in the range of min and max, as long as the most important method of body method signature and implementation logic, when the landlord just was the subject of 15 minutes into the pit. I have no experience with this, only lessons hope you can avoid, usually in addition to writing code, have time to practice reading code to quickly grasp the meaning of the code.


Given an array of size n containing numbers 1 through n + 1, find the missing number.
    Original title brush website, I use the bit algorithm

2. Find out the second largest number of the given value in BST.
    I traverse it directly, continuing to update max until equal to the given number

3. Given the first two numbers, print the Reverse Fibonacci sequence
    Very simple, direct f (n) = f (n - 1) - f (n - 2) on the line. However, a few tests, found not in line with fibonacci,

1. Remove node in LinkedList, find bug
2. "aaaabbbbcccd" to "a4b4c3d1", encode & decode.鐣欏璁哄潧-涓€浜�-涓夊垎鍦�
3. LC 253. Meeting Rooms II


1. Give a program that asks for bugs in the program.
Is a simple while loop, if the condition is written in reverse, and the conditions for exiting the loop are not specified, leading to an infinite loop Waral 鍗 鍗 鍗 澶 枃 枃       

2. Give a string array, each string is a phone number, the phone number may have two fixed forms, ABCDEFGHIJ or ABC-DEF-GHIJ, require that all phone numbers are changed to a uniform format: DEF-ABC-GHIJ. The topic requires minimizing the memory footprint.
According to the length of the input string to determine what form, in-place swap char elements, on it

3. A product array, each product has a different priority, high, medium and low, requires sorting, making the high priority appears in the front of array, low priority in the last, medium in the middle.
And LC 75 sort colors the same title, similar quick sort partition step

1. check balanced binary tree. At the beginning of a write up to bottom solution, and later finished and think of it better bottom to up solution, it is also written up.
             2. To correct the problem, the title is find kth elemnt fromend of linkedlist, the error is obvious.
             3. To a 2D matrix with only "1" and "0", 1 and 1 can be connected up and down, left and right to find the number of "1" group. Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/nu ... n-undirected-graph /, solved with union and find.



Give you a tree, each node has left, right, and next pointers. Now you want to point the next pointer to each node to the next node in the BFS. Do not require data structure (that is not allowed to use the queue to do BFS).

Solution: My answer is to use recursive DFS, limit the depth of each time, and then use a global variable to record the current node, the next one to find the next to the current node, and then the current node into a new node. When the current node is no longer changed, BFS is completed.
