Find Anagram Mappings 77.9% Easy
 Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
 We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.
 These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
 For example, given
 A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
 B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
 We should return
 [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
 as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
 Note:
     1. A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
     2. A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].
