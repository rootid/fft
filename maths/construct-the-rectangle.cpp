//Construct the Rectangle
//For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's
//size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to
//design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
//following requirements:
//1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
//target area.
//2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
//3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as
//possible.
//You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed
//in sequence.
//Example:
//Input: 4
//Output: [2, 2]
//Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it
//are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
//But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,
//[4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W
//is 2.
//Note:
//The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
//The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
