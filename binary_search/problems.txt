##  First Bad Version
### You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
	
## Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
### Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Example:
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,
return 13.
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n2.
	
## Guess Number Higher or Lower
### We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.
	
## H-Index II
### Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?
Hint:
Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.
