Partition Equal Subset Sum
   Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into 
    two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
    Note:
    Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
    The array size will not exceed 200.
    Example 1:
    Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
    Output: true
    Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
    Example 2:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
    
    The maximum possible sum is O(N^2). That makes DP O(N^3), 
    and backtracking is still O(2^N). 
    Even when N is around 20 they should be on about the same level, 
    for larger N backtracking should be prohibitively slow! And there are test cases as large as 50 elements.
