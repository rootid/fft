//Employee Free Time
//We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.
//Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.
//Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.
//Example 1:
//Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
//Output: [[3,4]]
//Explanation:
//There are a total of three employees, and all common
//free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
//We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
//Example 2:
//Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
//Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
//(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined.)
//Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.
//Note:
//    schedule and schedule[i] are lists with lengths in range [1, 50].
//    0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8.
