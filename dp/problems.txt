### Is Subsequence
## Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Return true.
Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Return false.
Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence.In this scenario, how would you change your code?
        
### Combination Sum IV
## Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
Example:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Therefore the output is 7.

### Wiggle Subsequence
## A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
Follow up:
Can you do it in O(n) time?
    
### Guess Number Higher or Lower II
## We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
Example:
n = 10, I pick 8.
First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
Hint:
The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face. Another strategy is to minimize the expected loss. Here, we are interested in the first scenario.
Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
Check out this article if you're still stuck.
The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n. You MUST use dynamic programming
   
 
### Largest Divisible Subset
## Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.
If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.
Example 1:
nums: [1,2,3]
Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
Example 2:
nums: [1,2,4,8]
Result: [1,2,4,8]
   
### Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K
## (QUEUE : hint) Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.
Example:
Given matrix = [
  [1,  0, 1],
  [0, -2, 3]
]
k = 2
The answer is 2. Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
Note:
The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
   
 
### Count Numbers with Unique Digits
## Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.
Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])
Hint:
A direct way is to use the backtracking approach.
Backtracking should contains three states which are (the current number, number of steps to get that number and a bitmask which represent which number is marked as visited so far in the current number). Start with state (0,0,0) and count all valid number till we reach number of steps equals to 10n.
This problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming approach and some knowledge of combinatorics.
Let f(k) = count of numbers with unique digits with length equals k.
f(1) = 10, ..., f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2) [The first factor is 9 because a number cannot start with 0].
    
### Russian Doll Envelopes
## You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers (w, h). One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.
What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside other)
Example:
Given envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]], the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
  
### Integer Break
##Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).
Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
Hint:
There is a simple O(n) solution to this problem.
You may check the breaking results of n ranging from 7 to 10 to discover the regularities.
  
### Counting Bits
##Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
Follow up:
It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
Hint:
You should make use of what you have produced already.
Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
 
  
### Coin Change
##You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
Example 1:
coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)
Example 2:
coins = [2], amount = 3
return -1.
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
    
### Create Maximum Number
## Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers. Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the k digits. You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.
Example 1:
nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
k = 5
return [9, 8, 6, 5, 3]
Example 2:
nums1 = [6, 7]
nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
k = 5
return [6, 7, 6, 0, 4]
Example 3:
nums1 = [3, 9]
nums2 = [8, 9]
k = 3
return [9, 8, 9]
   
### Burst Balloons
## Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
Note: 
(1) You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
(2) 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
Example:
Given [3, 1, 5, 8]
Return 167
    nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
   coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
 
### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Example 1:
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
Example 2:
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
     
### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
## Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
    
### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
## Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.
Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
     
### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
## Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:
prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
maxProfit = 3
transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
    
### Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable
## Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
Range Sum Query 2D
The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.
Example:
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11
sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12
Note:
You may assume that the matrix does not change.
There are many calls to sumRegion function.
You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.
    
### Range Sum Query - Immutable
## Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.
Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.
    
### Longest Increasing Subsequence
## Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
For example,
Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
### Perfect Squares
## Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
For example, given n = 12, return 3 because 12 = 4 + 4 + 4; given n = 13, return 2 because 13 = 4 + 9.
       
### Ugly Number II
## Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
Hint:
The naive approach is to call isUgly for every number until you reach the nth one. Most numbers are not ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5 from a smaller ugly number.
The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists: L1, L2, and L3.
Assume you have Uk, the kth ugly number. Then Uk+1 must be Min(L1 * 2, L2 * 3, L3 * 5).
    
### Maximal Square
## Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
For example, given the following matrix:
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
Return 4.
   
###  House Robber 
## You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
   
### House Robber II
## After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
    
### Dungeon Game
## The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
-2 (K)	-3	3
-5	-10	1
10	30	-5 (P)
    
### Maximum Product Subarray
##  Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
For example, given the array [2,3,-2,4],
the contiguous subarray [2,3] has the largest product = 6.
    
### Word Break II
## Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word.
Return all such possible sentences.
For example, given
s = "catsanddog",
dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"].
A solution is ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"].
    
### Palindrome Partitioning II
## Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
For example, given s = "aab",
Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
    
### Triangle
## Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
For example, given the following triangle
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
    
### Distinct Subsequences
## Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Return 3.
    
### Interleaving String
## Given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.
For example,
Given:
s1 = "aabcc",
s2 = "dbbca",
When s3 = "aadbbcbcac", return true.
When s3 = "aadbbbaccc", return false.
  
### Unique Binary Search Trees
## Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?
For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.
   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
    
### Unique Binary Search Trees II
## Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n.
For example,
Given n = 3, your program should return all 5 unique BST's shown below.
    
### Decode Ways
## A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
For example,
Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
### Scramble String
## Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".
Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".
  
## Maximal Rectangle
### Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
For example, given the following matrix:
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
Return 6. (STACK)
   
## Edit Distance
### Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
    
### Climbing Stairs
## You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
    
### Minimum Path Sum
## Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
    
### Unique Paths
## A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?
Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
    
### Unique Paths II
## Follow up for "Unique Paths":
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
    
### Maximum Subarray
## Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
click to show more practice.
More practice:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle
    
### Longest Valid Parentheses
## Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.
Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.
    
### Wildcard Matching
## Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)
Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "*") → true
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("ab", "?*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → false
    
### Regular Expression Matching
## Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)
Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("aa", ".*") → true
isMatch("ab", ".*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → true
	
### Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
## Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.
From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).
Example 1:
nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
Example 2:
nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
