//Frog Jump
//A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
//unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it
//must not jump into the water.
//Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
//determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last
//stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump
//must be 1 unit.
//If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1,
//k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
//Note:
//The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
//Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
//The first stone's position is always 0.
//Example 1:
//[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
//There are a total of 8 stones.
//The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
//third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
//The last stone at the 17th unit.
//Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping
//1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then
//2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
//4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
//Example 2:
//[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
//Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as
//the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
