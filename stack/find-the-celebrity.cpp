//Find the Celebrity
//Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among
//them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that
//all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
//Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not
//one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A.
//Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out
//the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as
//possible (in the asymptotic sense).
//You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A
//knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should
//minimize the number of calls to knows.
//Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return
//the celebrityâ€˜s label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no
//celebrity, return -1.

//The first loop is to exclude n - 1 labels that are not possible to be a
//celebrity.
//After the first loop, x is the only candidate.
//The second and third loop is to verify x is actually a celebrity by
//definition.
//The key part is the first loop. To understand this you can think the
//knows(a,b) as a a < b comparison, if a knows b then a < b, if a does not know
//b, a > b.
//Then if there is a celebrity, he/she must be the "maximum" of the n people.
//However, the "maximum" may not be the celebrity in the case of no celebrity
//at all.
//Thus we need the second and third loop to check if x is actually celebrity by
//definition.
//The total calls of knows is thus 3n at most. One small improvement is that in
//the second loop we only need to check i in the range [0, x). You can figure
//that out yourself easily.
