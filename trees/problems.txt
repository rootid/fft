## House Robber III
### The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
Example 1:
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
	
## Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
### Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
For example, you may serialize the following tree
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
	
## Binary Tree Paths
### Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
For example, given the following binary tree:
   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5
All root-to-leaf paths are:
["1->2->5", "1->3"]
	
## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
### Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
	
## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
### Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
	
## Kth Smallest Element in a BST
### Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
Hint:
Try to utilize the property of a BST.
What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
	
## Invert Binary Tree
### Invert a binary tree.
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
to
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
	
## Count Complete Tree Nodes
### Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
	
## Binary Tree Right Side View
### Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
For example:
Given the following binary tree,
   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---
You should return [1, 3, 4].
	
## Binary Search Tree Iterator
### Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
	
## Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
### Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.
An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
For example,
    1
   / \
  2   3
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
	
## Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
### Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
For example:
Given the below binary tree,
       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.
	
## Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
### Given a binary tree
    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
For example,
Given the following perfect binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL
	
	
## Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
### Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
For example,
Given the following binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
	
## Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
### Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
For example,
Given
         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6
click to show hints.
Hints:
If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.
	
## Path Sum 
### Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
	
## Path Sum II
### Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1
return
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
	
## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
### Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node
	
## Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
### Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
	
##  Balanced Binary Tree
### Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
	
## Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
### Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
	
## Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
### Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
	
## Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
### Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
	
## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
### Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
	
	
## Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
### Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
	
## Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
### Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
	
## Symmetric Tree
### Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
NOTE : Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
	
## Same Tree
### Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
	
## Recover Binary Search Tree
### Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
Recover the tree without changing its structure.
Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
	
## Validate Binary Search Tree
### Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Example 1:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
Example 2:
    1
   / \
  2   3
Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
	
## Unique Binary Search Trees
### Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?
For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.
   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
	
## Unique Binary Search Trees II
### Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n.
For example,
Given n = 3, your program should return all 5 unique BST's shown below.
   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
